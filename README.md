# CS410-Dining_Philosophers

// Need to adjust this still.

The	dining-philosophers	problem	is considered a classic	synchronization	problem	
neither	because	of its practical importance	nor	because	computer scientists	dislike	
philosophers but because it	is an example of a large class of concurrency-control	
problems. It is	a simple representation	of the need	to allocate	several	resources	
among several processes	in a deadlock-free and starvation-free	manner.
